Task 1; The task is to make a circuit that responds to physical activity with another physical activity. The device is built in a simulatiom environment in TinkerCad. Further instructions are in Instruction-electronics1.pdf. The device can be viewed in the online text provided (input), and the brief description of how the device works can be viewed in the text.

Task 2; Circuit board (PCB) design, using KiCad software. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design involved; creating a circuit schematic with KiCad, creating and editing a PCB layout with KiCad, and finally, generating the work files from the design with KiCad. Schematic for the design, completed layout and the copper plane can be observed.
